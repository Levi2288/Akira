Looking for developers to expend Akira!!!

What are we looking for

- java dev
- C++ dev 
- and maybe a website developer ? questionmark i want to make a good website / login thing but i dont have the time to learn that too

do u get paid if you join us?

hmmmm no maybe in long term we will go paid and you will get your own cut but for now we are just a little "learning" project but this does not mean we are not trying to be the best one are out there. So if you want to help me then come lets code together and make Akira a a big cheating community.
